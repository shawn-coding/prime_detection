# prime_detection
simple program that lists the prime numbers of a list of other numbers, plus some lambda practice

I wanted to practice with lambda and some other commands to make smaller and more elegant code.

The program starts with a list of random numbers, some are prime, some aren't. The program checks each one using lambda
functions and puts them into a filtered list in one line, then prints the resulting list of primes to the terminal.
